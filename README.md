# Advent of Code Solutions

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions! I discovered AoC
in 2019, and ever since I've done every year in a different language. Most
are incomplete, but I plan to eventually go back and get every star. If I'm
feeling particularly motivated, I may clean up old code, but I probably
won't change the general approches to problems.
